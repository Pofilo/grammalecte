If you got the source code from a zip archive, you must first uncompress the archive
in `gc_lang/fr/dictionnaire/lexique/corpus_data`. (It isnâ€™t possible to upload the
source code as is to Mozilla website, as these files are considered too big.)


## MailExtension

The MailExtension is built upon the Grammalecte [WebExtension](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/grammalecte-fr/).

Both extensions use the same code. Only one file differs: manifest.json
